   d. Execution Simulation:
      - Use Matter.js for physics-based interactions
      - Implement a "body part" system for realistic dismemberment
      - Create a "life simulation" system (blood loss, shock, pain)

   e. Assignment System:
      - Daily assignments with specific instructions
      - Outcome evaluation based on performance

   f. Economy System:
      - Track player's wealth
      - Implement a simple market for tools and necessities

   g. Time Management:
      - Day/night cycle
      - Schedule for work and personal time

4. Detailed System Designs:

   a. Stick Figure Rendering:
      - Use Phaser 3's graphics capabilities to draw stick figures
      - Implement a skeletal animation system for smooth movement
      - Use TweenMax for advanced animations (e.g., swinging axe)

   b. Physics Simulation:
      - Integrate Matter.js with Phaser 3
      - Create composite bodies for characters (head, torso, limbs)
      - Implement collision detection for weapons and body parts

   c. Life Simulation System:
      - Create a class to manage vital signs (blood, pain, consciousness)
      - Implement gradual changes based on injuries and time
      - Use events to trigger state changes (unconsciousness, death)

   d. Assignment Management:
      - Design a data structure for assignments (prisoner info, instructions, rewards)
      - Implement a scoring system based on adherence to instructions
      - Create a UI for displaying current assignment and past performance

   e. Character Progression:
      - Design an experience system for the player character
      - Implement skill improvements based on performance
      - Create a reputation system affecting interactions with NPCs

   f. User Interface:
      - Design a minimalist UI fitting the medieval theme
      - Implement inventory management screen
      - Create status displays for player attributes and current assignment

   g. Sound Design:
      - Use Howler.js for managing sound effects and background music
      - Implement dynamic audio based on game events and environment

5. Asset Management:
   - Create a simple stick figure character creator
   - Design basic environments (execution yard, home, town) using simple shapes and colors
   - Implement a particle system for blood and other effects

6. Save System:
   - Use browser's localStorage for saving game progress
   - Implement auto-save feature and manual save option

7. Performance Optimization:
   - Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects (e.g., blood particles)
   - Implement efficient collision detection using spatial partitioning

8. Extensibility:
   - Design modular systems to allow easy addition of new execution methods, assignments, and town events
   - Implement an event system for triggering random occurrences

9. Development Roadmap:
   a. Phase 1: Core Mechanics
      - Basic stick figure rendering and animation
      - Simple physics interactions
      - Rudimentary assignment system

   b. Phase 2: Simulation Depth
      - Implement detailed life simulation system
      - Expand physics to include dismemberment
      - Develop comprehensive assignment and scoring system

   c. Phase 3: Player Progression
      - Implement character attributes and progression
      - Develop economy system
      - Create town interactions and reputation system

   d. Phase 4: Polish and Expansion
      - Refine UI and add tutorials
      - Implement sound design
      - Add random events and expanded content

10. Testing Strategy:
    - Unit tests for core systems (life simulation, physics interactions)
    - Integration tests for game loop and scene transitions
    - Playtesting for balance and engagement

This architecture provides a solid foundation for your medieval executioner simulation game. It leverages Phaser 3's capabilities for 2D game development while incorporating additional libraries for physics and animations. The modular design allows for easy expansion and iteration as the game develops.

To get started, a developer should focus on setting up the Phaser 3 environment, implementing basic stick figure rendering, and creating the core game loop with simple scene transitions. From there, they can gradually implement the more complex systems like physics interactions and the life simulation system.
